<h1>Hyperion.ai Service Shutdown Notice</h1>
<p>Hello! Thank you for your interest in Hyperion.ai. Unfortunately, Hyperion.ai the Hyperion.ai
service is currently in the process of being shut down and is not accepting any new registrations or
downloads. Hyperion Industries no longer has the resources to continue operating and supporting the
service to our standards so we have made the difficult decision to shut down the service.</p>
<p>If you are a current user, we have included some details in the following section on how to
migrate your data off of Hyperion.ai.</p>
<h2>Next Steps for Current Users</h2>
<h3>Final Day</h3>
<p>Current users will be able to use the app until July 7, 2017. After which the servers will
officially be taken down and become inaccessible from the app.</p>

<h3>Exporting Data before October 7, 2017</h3>
<p>To export your data at any time before October 7, 2017, current users can follow the following
    steps to export their data:

        Click on the "Settings" link in the top left.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select "Export Data" and follow the remaining steps that appear.
    </li>

</p>

<h3>Exporting Data before March 10, 2018</h3>

Request" as the Subject. Please make sure you use the same email you used to sign up to the service.

    Your data will be exported as a CSV that conforms to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt">RFC 4180</a> specification proposal.
